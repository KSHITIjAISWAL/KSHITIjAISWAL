### Hi there 👋

This is Kshitij Jaiswal, I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate. I'm an avid learner and have interest in many different technological fields. Currently I am learning about Data Analysis and Machine Learning and trying to develop an in-depth knowledge about the topics.

My areas of interest include:-
1. Data Science
2. Web Development
3. Python Programming

Trying to learn different technologies and brushing up my programming skills too. 🌱
- 🔭 I’m currently working on different Machine Learning projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Google’s first tweet was in 2009, and it was gibberish to most. Translated from binary to English, it reads, “I’m feeling lucky”.
